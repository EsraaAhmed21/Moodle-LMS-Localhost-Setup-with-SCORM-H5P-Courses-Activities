# Moodle-LMS-Localhost-Setup-with-SCORM-H5P-Courses-Activities

# Project Overview
This project showcases my ability to set up a Moodle LMS on a local server and integrate various interactive learning elements. I have added SCORM courses, H5P interactive content, quizzes, and multiple learning activities. Since the platform is hosted locally, I have provided a video walkthrough demonstrating its functionality.
